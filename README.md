# Pillar Peril

Pillar Peril in a open-source game mode with the base concept of starting on pillars (bedrock towers) and getting a random item every few seconds. Some items can help you build up or to other players, some can kill other players or prevent you from getting killed, or if you have bad luck, some items can be just thrown away.  
Based on my research, this game originated from a popular YouTube channel called [CheapPickle](https://youtube.com/@CheapPickle) and was later adapted by the popular Minecraft server, [CubeCraft](https://www.cubecraft.net/).

## Special about this Version

The special part about this plugin is the high *customizability* and *huge amount of different modes*!  
Here are *some* of the many different modes that are available:
Name | Credits | Cooldown | Description
---|---|---|---
Original | [CheapPickle](https://youtube.com/@CheapPickle) | 10s | The original game mode, as seen on CheapPickle's Shorts.
CubeCraft | [CubeCraft](https://www.cubecraft.net/) | 5s | Similar to the one seen on CubeCraft. Some things, like boats are excluded and there's a circular floor under the pillars.
Chaos | Me :) | 3s | No item filters, pillars aren't in a circle, but just randomized and the item cooldown is very fast.
Blocky | Friends | 10s | At the beginning, you get a random tool. For the rest of the game, you only get blocks, which makes the game more movement-based and allows for longer games.
Soon! | ??? | ??? | More modes are coming soon!

## Usage

**Limits:**
> There's no limit of how many players can partake in a game, as the map scales with the amount of players.
